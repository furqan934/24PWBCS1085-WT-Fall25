# Lab 01 Report

During this lab, I learned how to use Git for version control. I practiced creating and managing files in a repository, adding a `.gitignore`, and writing a LICENSE file.  
I also learned how to create, switch, and merge branches, which showed me how teams can work on features separately and then combine them into the main project.  
Overall, this lab helped me understand the importance of commits, pushing to GitHub, and keeping a clean project history.
